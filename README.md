## 🧠 Core Strength: Data Structures & Algorithms

- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Time & Space Complexity analysis

> I apply DSA concepts directly while designing APIs, optimizing backend logic, and building scalable systems.
